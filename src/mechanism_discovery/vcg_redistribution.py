"""Exact finite-grid synthesis for anonymous VCG redistribution rules.

The public project costs one.  Each agent type is in a finite subset of
``[0, 1]`` and the efficient allocation builds exactly when the reported sum
reaches one.  Following the Groves representation used in the public-project
redistribution literature, a symmetric rule is represented by ``h(theta_-i)``.
At a profile theta, truthful utility of agent i is ``S(theta) - h(theta_-i)``,
where ``S(theta) = max(sum(theta), 1)``.  Hence individual rationality is
``h(theta_-i) <= S(theta)`` and no deficit is
``sum_i h(theta_-i) >= (n - 1) S(theta)``.

This module deliberately uses only exact ``Fraction`` arithmetic.  It is a
finite-grid oracle, not a claim about the continuous public-project problem.
